# Cafe App

### An app that allows you to create menu items and add them to your menu

To run the app, go to the root and run:

1- `npm run install-all`

2- `npm run start-all`

That's it!

The React front-end server will run on port 3000 and node JS back-end will run on port 4200 by default.

Please check `package.json` file in each of the front-end and the back-end directories to take a glance into used packages.

Hint: I have not used aws-s3 to upload images, I used the front-end service `filestack-react` instead, as it gives users so much flexibility, for instance, they can use images that are on their Facebook account, in addition to its ease of use and implementation.
